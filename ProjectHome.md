Caas is a tool to Automate many Cordys Administration tasks, using scripting technology, such as Groovy. Caas currently works with Cordys versions C2, C3 and BOP-4

What can caas do?
  * interactive shell that can do many things that Cordys Explorer can do, and many new things
  * scripting to automate any task that you could do manually in the interactive shell
  * view differences between two Cordys installations, organizations, soap nodes or any other similar objects.
  * view a Cordys installation offline
  * package manager, for automatic deployment, configuration and validation of isv packages
  * view and grep log4j xml logfiles to line based format, and thus use Unix command line tools.

The idea is to be able to automate many tasks that a administrator or developer needs to do often. Not only will this reduce time and effort, but it will also improve the quality, since there is less chance for human errors.
